	<p>My Ph.D. thesis is titled 'Consuming America'. In this thesis, I paired computational text-mining techniques 
		and more traditional historical methods to analyze the representation of the United States in more than
		fifty million articles and twenty million advertisements in twentieth-century digitized Dutch newspapers. 
		Consuming America offers a data-driven, longitudinal analysis of the historical dynamics of the United States 
		as a reference culture in public debates related to modernizing Dutch consumer society. 
		In the book I conclude that despite periods of flagrant anti-Americanism in the Netherlands, 
		for Dutch people the United States functioned as a persistent beacon of consumerism, modernization, 
		and globalization throughout the twentieth century.</p>
