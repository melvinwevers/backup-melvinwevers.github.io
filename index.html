	<p>For my Ph.D. research, I examined how the United States emerged as a reference culture in Dutch public discourse on consumer goods. 
		For this I used extensive digitzed newspaper collection of the National Library of the Netherlands. By pairing computational tools with more 
		traditional hermeneutical methods, I explored, analyzed, and visualized cultural patterns in over 50 million 
		newspaper articles and almost 20 million advertisements.<p>
	<p>Right now, I'm working as researcher-in-residence at the National Library. In this six-month research project, I explored how non-textual features 
		of advertisements can be used for historical analysis. This involves size and position of ads, but also the use of neural networks to identity
		visual trends and objects in advertisements.</p>
